## Problem 1: Traffic Sign Classification using CNNs
### Context
This problem focuses on utilizing Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) for Traffic Sign Recognition on the German Traffic Sign Recognition Benchmark (GTSRB). This is a critical component for autonomous driving systems and CNNs are particularly effective in computer vision tasks due to their ability to learn hierarchical features from raw pixel data. In this assignment, we experiment with different architecture of CNNs and analyze their performances.

### Dataset
The dataset for traffic sign classification is the German Traffic Sign Recognition Benchmark (GTSRB). It consists of thousands of labeled images of traffic signs. It contains "43 classes of traffic signs, split into 39,209 training images and 12,630 test images. The images have varying light conditions and rich backgrounds."

## Problem 2: Used Car Price Prediction
Smile detection is a binary classification problem where the goal is to identify if a person in an image is smiling or not. This task is important in applications such as emotion recognition, photography, and user interaction systems. In this assignment, we experiment with different architecture of CNNs and analyze their performances.

### Dataset
The dataset for this problem is the [Happy House Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/iarunava/happy-house-dataset), which contains 64x64 colored images of faces labeled as "smiling" or "not smiling."
