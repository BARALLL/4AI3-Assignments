## Problem 1: Chest X-Ray Disease Classification
### Context
A Toronto hospital needs an automated system to classify chest X-ray images into four disease categories (Healthy, COVID-19, Bacterial Pneumonia, Viral Pneumonia) for faster and cheaper diagnosis.

The task involves training a deep learning model using Google Teachable Machines to classify chest X-ray images, evaluating its performance (confusion matrix, loss curve), and optimizing hyperparameters (epochs, learning rate, batch size) to improve accuracy.

### Dataset
Provided by the professor. The original dataset could not be located by the repository's author; however, several similar datasets are publicly available online. It is composed of four classes: Healthy, COVID-19, Bacterial Pneumonia, Viral Pneumonia with 133 images per class for the training set and 10 images per class for the test set.


## Problem 2: Used Car Price Prediction
### Context
A car dealership wants a machine learning model to predict used car prices based on various vehicle features to optimize pricing strategies.

This project requires preprocessing a dataset of car features (make, model, engine specs, etc.), training a regression model (e.g., linear regression, decision tree, random forest) in scikit-learn to predict the MSRP (Manufacturer's Suggested Retail Price), and evaluating the model's performance using metrics like MSE and R-squared.
